Using the geometry given in Figure 5.9 and considering that the geometry is 2D, calculate the pressure distribution over the nose of the body from the leading edge, x = 0.01370207, to x = 3.291. The upstream flow Mach number is M1 = 3, γ = 1.4, P1 = 101325 Pa, T1 = 298.15 K.
The geometry is defined by the following equation:
y=-0.008333+0.609425*x-〖0.092593*x〗^2
Normalize the pressure distribution over the body by the upstream pressure, P1.
Plot P / P1 using the following methods and compare your results to the pressure distribution given in Figure 5.10:
	Newtonian method
	Modified Newtonian method
	Tangent-Wedge method
	Shock-Expansion method
